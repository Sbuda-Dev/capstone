II. How to create Django project

I. This is a program where a user can view an online gallery (museum).
The user will have to create a username and password using Django.
Once their credentials have been added and authenticated, the user will
be able to view the exhibits on the webpage.
There is a requirements lists that comes with the program which will assist
the user with installing all the necessary programs.

II. To run the program, the user first needs to create a Django project.
To do this, create a folder and give it any name.
In the folder, usng a terminal on your preferred IDE, create a virtual environment.
After having created the virtual environment, activate it by navigating to
the 'Scripts' folder.
After the virtual environment has been activated, install Django via your IDE.
Once Django has been installed, use the command "python manage.py startapp [your app name]"
to create a Django project.

Once the project is running, you'll be able to set up the html for the exhibit webpage.
If you get stuck, you can refer to the "Pictures" folder.
